Subject: mmc: increase SD write timeout for crappy cards

From: Pierre Ossman <drzeus@drzeus.cx>

commit 493890e75d98810a3470b4aae23be628ee5e9667 upstream.

It seems that some cards are slightly out of spec and occasionally
will not be able to complete a write in the alloted 250 ms [1].
Incease the timeout slightly to allow even these cards to function
properly.
