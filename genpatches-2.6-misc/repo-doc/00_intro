Repository layout for linux-patches/genpatches-2.6
==================================================

trunk: This contains the 'branches' which we are actively developing.
       Each branch is held in its own directory, e.g. "2.6.11" and "2.6.12-pre"
	   -pre versions represent development patchsets for latest -rc kernels.

tags: Whenever we snapshot a branch and release it in tarballs, we tag it in
      the repository, as the full kernel name plus our own release version,
	  e.g. 2.6.11-9

historical: When we stop actively developing a branch, we move the branch as-is
            to here.

Checking out the working repository
===================================

Most of the time, you will only need to work under trunk - there is no point
checking out all the tagged and historical branches.
