<h2>What is genpatches?</h2>

<p>
genpatches is a patchset applied to many of Gentoo's Linux kernel packages. It
aims to support the entire range of Gentoo-supported architectures.
</p>

<p>
Each patchset is based on the initial stable release of the kernel's released at
kernel.org (e.g. 2.6.10, 2.6.11, 2.6.12). 
</p>

<p>
The patchset is split up into two parts: base and extras. base contains bug and
security fixes, while extras includes some extra hardware support and some
feature patches.
</p>

<p>
genpatches is mainly produced for <b>gentoo-sources</b>, which is the only
kernel to include both base and extras.
</p>

<h2>Patching policy</h2>

<p>
We aim to keep genpatches as a minimal patchset for two reasons:
</p>

<ol><li>Ease of maintenance and debugging</li>
<li>Minimal deviation from upstream releases</li></ol>

The second point being the most important - we don't want to be seen as one of those distro's that run a heavily patched kernel. We also want to be able to easily update our base to new stable kernel releases soon after they appear.

With that in mind, here are the types of patches that we include:<br />
<ol>
<li>Bug fixes</li>

<li>Security fixes</li>
<li>Arch-specific compatibility</li>
<li>Features required or beneficial for Gentoo LiveCDs</li>
</ol>

In general, we try to stick to only applying patches from the upstream Linux development branch.

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>
For now we are just working on each new kernel release, adding upstream patches to solve any problems that have appeared, while keeping up-to-date with the kernel.org stable releases.
</p>

<p>
We also aim to increase the number of Gentoo-provided kernels which include
genpatches-base. This greatly reduces the maintenance of those other kernels
since all security patch handling is done in one place only.
