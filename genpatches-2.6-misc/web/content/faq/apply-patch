Will you apply [some kernel patch]?
If it's a serious and non-intrusive bugfix that has been accepted into the upstream development kernel, then usually yes (please open a bug). Otherwise, generally the answer is no - instead of getting new features added to our kernel, we'd prefer you to contact the authors of that code and get them to finish off their work and submit it to the mainline kernel so that everyone can benefit.
