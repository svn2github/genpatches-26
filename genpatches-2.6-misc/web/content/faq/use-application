Why dont you have a USE flag for [...]?
When we deem a patch as too experimental to be included in genpatches, a common response is "ok, so why don't you give the users a choice by using a USE flag to decide whether this patch gets applied or not?". The reason we don't do this is because this would greatly increase maintenance - we'd have to test multiple USE flag combinations, etc. We also aim to produce a single set of patches which works reliably everywhere.
