My ALPS touchpad isn't working as of 2.6.11/2.6.12
--
As of 2.6.11, an ALPS touchpad driver was introduced in the kernel (previously, it just emulated it as a standard mouse). This means that the default behaviour changed slightly. You should use the synaptics Xorg driver, see the <a href="http://web.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/">homepage</a> for more info.

The new driver seems to be working reliably now.
