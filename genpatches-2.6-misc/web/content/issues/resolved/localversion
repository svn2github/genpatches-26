modprobe can't find modules installed through portage
Modules are being installed into the wrong place
My kernel version has an "n" on the end (e.g. 2.6.9-gentoo-r1n)
localversion is not yet used by portage

Kernel 2.6.9 introduced a new option (localversion) allowing you to specify some text to add onto the end of your kernel version string. Many people mistook this for a yes/no option (especially the "make oldconfig" users) and ended up setting this to the letter "n". For this reason, you may well have a kernel version string such as "2.6.9-gentoo-r1n".
Portage does not yet support localversion and will install external modules (e.g. nvidia-kernel) using the normal "2.6.9-gentoo-r1" path. If you entered a localversion (or accidently chose "n") then this will mean that these modules are getting installed in the wrong place. For now, unset CONFIG_LOCALVERSION and remove /usr/src/linux/localversion* and recompile your kernel. The portage developers are working on localversion support for a future releases. Additionally, kernel module ebuilds are being migrated to a new backend which does support localversion correctly.

Most ebuilds in portage now support localversion correctly.
