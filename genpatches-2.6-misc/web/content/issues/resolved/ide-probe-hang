Kernel hangs for about 30 seconds during bootup, "Probing IDE" messages are displayed
--
<b>An IDE update that went into 2.6.9 is responsible for this.</b> This non-critical issue can be solved by disabling Generic IDE and enabling support for your specific IDE controller in your kernel config.

See <a href="http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3615">this bug</a> for more info.
