System is unstable when 64GB HIGHMEM is enabled
I have more than 4GB RAM and my system is unstable

One of the patches in Gentoo's patchset seems to be causing problems. We are currently waiting for 2.6.13 to come out so that we can debug the issue with a smaller patchset. For now you can use 64GB highmem with vanilla-sources with no problems.
