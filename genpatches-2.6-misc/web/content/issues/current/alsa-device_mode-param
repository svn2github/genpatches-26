"Unknown parameter device_mode" error
ALSA broken; lots of "Unknown symbol" messages appear on load
--
ALSA has recently dropped the device_mode parameter. If you still have this paremeter in use, then the module load will fail. You'll see a message (maybe only in "dmesg"):

<blockquote>snd: Unknown parameter `device_mode'</blockquote>

Immediately after this message, you'll see *many* messages like these:

<blockquote>snd_timer: Unknown symbol snd_info_register
snd_timer: Unknown symbol snd_info_create_module_entry
snd_timer: Unknown symbol snd_info_free_entry
snd_timer: Unknown symbol snd_verbose_printk</blockquote>

Note that the "Unknown symbol" messages aren't actually correct - the real problem is the device_node parameter, but people tend to miss that error because it gets flooded out by all the "Unknown symbol" messages.

This is usually caused by a file in <i>/etc/modules.d</i> supplying a device_mode parameter.

To find which file is supplying this, you can do:

<blockquote><pre># grep device_mode /etc/modules.d/*</pre></blockquote>

Usually, it is a file called <b>alsa</b> containing the line:

<blockquote>options snd  device_mode=0666</blockquote>

Remove this line, save the file, run <i>modules-update</i>, and the problem should be solved.
