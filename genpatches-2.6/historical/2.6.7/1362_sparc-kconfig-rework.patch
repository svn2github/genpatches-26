From http://dev.gentoo.org/~wesolows

Major rework of the sparc and sparc64 Kconfigs to more closely match the
structure and layout of x86.  It also adds a large number of dependencies
to drivers so they will only appear when the system configuration is
compatible with the devices they service.

-	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with

-	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
-	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
-	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
-	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
-	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
-	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.
-
-	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
-	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
-	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
-	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
-	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
-	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
-	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.
-
-	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
-	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an

-	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
-	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
-	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
-	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
-	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
-	  and xterms.
-
-	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
-	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
-	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
-	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
-	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
-	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
-	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
-	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

-config VT
-	bool "Virtual terminal" if EMBEDDED
-	select INPUT
-	default y
-	---help---
-	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
-	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
-	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
-	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
-	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
-	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
-	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
-	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.
-
-	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
-	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
-	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
-	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
-	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
-	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
-	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.
-
-	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
-	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
-	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
-	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial

-	  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages

-	  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
-	  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
-	  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
-	  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
-	  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).
-
-	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
-	  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
-	  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
-	  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man
-	  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or
-	  loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

-	bool "Unix98 PTY support"
-	---help---
-	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
-	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
-	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
-	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
-	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
-	  and xterms.
-
-	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
-	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
-	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
-	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
-	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
-	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
-	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
-	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.
-
-	  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
-	  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
-	  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.
-
-	  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
