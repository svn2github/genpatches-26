Subject: tty: enable the echoing of ^C in the N_TTY discipline
X-Git-Url: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux%2Fkernel%2Fgit%2Ftorvalds%2Flinux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=ec5b1157f8e819c72fc93aa6d2d5117c08cdc961

tty: enable the echoing of ^C in the N_TTY discipline

Turn on INTR/QUIT/SUSP echoing in the N_TTY line discipline (e.g.  ctrl-C
will appear as "^C" if stty echoctl is set and ctrl-C is set as INTR).

Linux seems to be the only unix-like OS (recently I've verified this on
Solaris, BSD, and Mac OS X) that does *not* behave this way, and I really
miss this as a good visual confirmation of the interrupt of a program in
the console or xterm.  I remember this fondly from many Unixs I've used
over the years as well.  Bringing this to Linux also seems like a good way
to make it yet more compliant with standard unix-like behavior.
