  [VLAN]: Fix early vlan adding leads to not functional device
  
  OK, I can see what's happening here. eth0 doesn't detect link-up until
  after a few seconds, so when the vlan interface is opened immediately
  after eth0 has been opened, it inherits the link-down state. Subsequently
  the vlan interface is never properly activated and are thus unable to
  transmit any packets.
  
  dev->state bits are not supposed to be manipulated directly. Something
  similar is probably needed for the netif_device_present() bit, although
  I don't know how this is meant to work for a virtual device.
